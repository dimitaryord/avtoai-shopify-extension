###CODE_INTERPRENTER###
always get data from products-${some_id}.json file for the products
these are the fields foreach product item in the products file: 
     - id
     - product_handle
     - product_title
     - product_type
     - product_tags
     - product_description
     - variant_id
     - variant_display_name
     - variant_price
     - variant_compare_at_price
     - variant_weight
     - variant_requires_shipping
     - variant_taxable
     - variant_color? 
     - variant_size?

### Objective
Write a Python script that loads JSON data representing a collection of products, identifies products matching specific criteria ( for color, size and others specific options for a product look up the variant_${criteria} where the ${criteria} is the criteria asked from the client) (e.g., if there is  "snowboard" in product_title and variant_price is under $1000, if the variant_color is "blue" and price is over 2000$), and outputs a these filetered products product_handle and variant_id.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- JSON data format understanding
- Basic knowledge of conditional statements and loops in Python

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
```python
import json
```

#### Step 2: Load JSON Data
- If the JSON data is provided as a string, use `json.loads()` to parse it.
- If the JSON data is stored in a file, use `json.load()` within a `with open('file_path.json')` block to read and parse it.

#### Step 3: Define Search Criteria
- Specify the criteria for filtering products. For example, the product title should contain "snowboard", and the price must be less than $1000.

#### Step 4: Implement Filtering Logic
- Iterate through each product in the JSON data.
- For each product, check if it meets the specified search criteria.
- Use `float()` to convert the string price to a floating-point number before comparison.

#### Step 5: Handle Matching Products
- Store matching products in a list or return them directly.
- If storing, initialize an empty list before the loop and append matching products to this list.

#### Step 6: Error Handling
- Include error handling for common issues, such as:
  - JSON parsing errors.
  - Incorrect data formats (e.g., non-numeric price values).
- Use try-except blocks to gracefully handle these errors.

#### Step 7: Output Results
- Return a random product's product_handle and variant_id from the list of matching products or a message indicating if no products match the criteria.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure JSON data is correctly formatted and accessible to the script.
- Replace `[Your JSON data here]` with the actual JSON string or adjust the script to load JSON from a file.
